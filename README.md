Code for the first smart contract in solidity.
===
Getting used to the environment:
---
Using the test Network in remix.ethereum.org, with the Javascript VM.  
- In that case there are no delays because validating the proof of work takes miliseconds.  
Creating account in Chrome extension Metamask, using the test Network Rinkeby
- We grab some test eth before we start.

Creating our own network
---
- first testing with ganache
